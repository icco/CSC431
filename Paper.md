## Outline

Each group will submit a paper detailing the design and implementation of their compiler project.
This paper must
• Outline the overall architecture of the solution.
• Describe the representation of key data (e.g., control flow graphs and instructions).
• Outline optimizations implemented.
• Provide a section detailing the performance of the code generated for the benchmarks. This section should
  contain graphs comparing the run-times of the generated code (with and without optimizations) and the
  C equivalent code compiled using gcc (with and without optimizations).
